## Download and Installation

I wrote this code with [VSCode](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/), you also can run the project on your computer with VSCode or with one of the alternative programs like Atom, Brackets or Geany. If you don't have any, please download and install (It's free).

## Preparation

When you downloaded and installed program, open it! Download zip file with my project on your desktop, unzip it and drag whole folder into VSCode (or alternative program). Find file index.html and run it! That's all!
